Spectral Analysis Functions

This repository contains basic spectral analysis functions using MATLAB. The functions are designed to allow the user to replicate some of the built-in MATLAB functions from scratch. There is also a variation of the LSSA and LSWA algorithms (Ghaderpour, E., Pagiatakis, S.D., 2019) which include some additional outputs.
